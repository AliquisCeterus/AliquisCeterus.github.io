I have no clue what I'm doing <br>
This is just a website i made so i can link to it on social medias, and have it link to other things. <br>
it's very barebones because i'm lazy and haven't touched html in 5 years. <br>
at this point, i've decided i want to keep it this way, so if for some reason you want to improve it, please limit the active files to just index.html. <br>
note that this means inline css only. have fun. <br>
