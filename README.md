I have no clue what I'm doing
This is just a website i made so i can link to it on social medias, and have it link to other things.
it's very barebones because i'm lazy and haven't touched html in 5 years.
at this point, i've decided i want to keep it this way, so if for some reason you want to improve it, please limit the active files to just index.html. 
note that this means inline css only. have fun.
